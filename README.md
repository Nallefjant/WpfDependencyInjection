# WpfDependencyInjection

The Dependecy Injection magic all happens thanks to UnityConfig.cs in WpfPractiseApplication.App_Start where you register which interfaces corresponds to which classes.

A great thing with dependency injection is that you require a lot less dependencies which makes it easy to write unit tests.
